# RetroPod
A C++ / OpenGL 3d Hovercraft Simulator type Game with retro graphics and some mind-melting maths behind the scenes that's actually really really fun

# Installation Instructions (Windows):
Just download the zip file, unzip it, then bould click on the .exe (which required the glut.dll to be in the same directory).
If you get stuck see instructions.txt file in the retropod directory.

# Installation for Mac / Linux:
You need to compile the source yourself, sorry.

# To play the game
Double click on 'Hot Marble Action.exe' to play the game. Make sure the .dll and all the 5 strangely named txt files are in the same directory as the exe. These files define the levels.

Once in the main game, here are the keys:

Arrow keys to move around:
UP - both fans forward.
Left / Right - one fan forward, one fan back.
Back - both fans back

f = full screen.
w = not full screen
p = pause/unpause
esc = quit. - p.s. don't use the close icon on the window to quit - it sometimes doesn't shut the process down properly - i'm fairly sure this is a problem with the glut32.dll file.

# What Files are included:
 - *the zip file* is everything in one file
 - *the /retropod directory* contains everything you need to run the game (on windows), the exe, the level config files and a dll. So long as they are all in the same directory the exe will run and the game will work.
 - *the /retropod/Source Code directory* contains all the source you need to compile on other platforms (please let me know if you do this i'd love to see it runing under mac/linux :)

# RetroPod
A C++ / OpenGL 3D Hovercraft Simulator type Game with retro graphics and some mind-melting maths behind the scenes that's actually really quite fun to say i wrote it fresh out of uni back in 2002.\
I seem to remember having dial-up internet at the time and using notepad.exe on windows as my text editor to write my code!!!!

# Installation Instructions (Windows):
Just download the contents of the dist_win directory (all 8 files) and double click RetroPod.exe to play the game\
If you get stuck see instructions.txt file in the dist_win directory.

# Installation for Mac:
Just download the contents of the dist_mac directory (all 7 files). Don't double click RetroPod executable, instead 'cd' to it in the terminal then run from terminal: ./RetroPod\
If you get stuck see instructions.txt file in the dist_win directory.

# To play the game
Once in the main game, here are the keys:\
\
Arrow keys to move around:\
UP - both fans forward.\
Left / Right - one fan forward, one fan back.\
Back - both fans back\
\
f = full screen\
w = windowed (not full screen)\
p = pause/unpause\
esc = quit\
NOTE: On Windows please press 'esc' and not close icon on the window to quit - it sometimes doesn't shut the process down properly - i'm fairly sure this is a problem with the glut32.dll file.

# What Files are included:
Ive also included the source files and a shell script for compiling on mac. I lost my script for windows because i wrote the game 17 years ago, but it wont be hard to take the mac one and create one for windows. Job for a rainy day i guess.
